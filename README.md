## Introduction
The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating
by occurring every four years but two years apart.

In this project, we are going to see the Olympics Data analysis using Python and PySpark.The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sports events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. 
The Olympic Games are considered the worldâ€™s foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. Around 110 countiers have won the medals in different category of sports. 
Totally there are 49 sports. The Dataset contains the olympics winners from year 2000 to 2012.

For every event there are three winners ( like Gold Medal, Silver Medal and Bronze Medal ). Therefore various data is generated. So, by using Python I will analyze this data.

In PySpark project, Using the Olympic Data set that have been Cleaned in pandas like removing duplicates and special characters that present in features.
## Problem Statement:
Throughout this project, I will explore the Olympics dataset, clean the data and look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country has won more number of Medals in Olympic Games.

## Libraries:
* Python
* PySpark
* Numpy #linear algebra
* Pandas # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
* Seaborn & Matplotlib #data plotting

### Purpose
This dataset can be used for predictive data analytics purpose.
